title: Episodic DnD Campaign!
---

**Hello players!** 

This is my attempt at making more work for myself by having a website with campaign information. I got the idea from a DnD youtube video about using github to make a wiki-styled website for all the campaign information. If this is terribly overwhelming, I'll probably drop it. 

To the left is an explorer tab that has drop-down menus for different things I take notes on - feel free to click around and see what you think. 

### The most relevant links might be these ones:
- [[Job Board]], which has the current options for sessions posted. 
- The `Session Notes` folder has my notes from each session. 
- [[Hidden Valley]] has the deets on your home town on [[Ranch]], which I'll try to populate with lore and whatnot. 
- All the PCs in the party are in the `PCs` folder, if you have any backstory/lore it'll be there. Otherwise it'll be where I track your character's quests/goals/motivations.
