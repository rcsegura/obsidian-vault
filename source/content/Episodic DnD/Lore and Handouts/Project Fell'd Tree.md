**From:** Office of Strategic Resource Expansion, Cedrax Inc.  
**To:** Project Oversight Committee, Sector 19  
**Subject:** PROJECT FELL'D TREE — Strategic Update and Phase 2 Clearance  
**Date:** [REDACTED-YEAR]–04–19

---

**Overview:**  
Project Fell'd Tree has successfully completed Phase 1: environmental destabilization across designated sectors of the [[Ha’aretsia]] forest biosphere. The pathogenic vector (Fusarium caudata var. 17X-R) is showing the expected progression curve.

**Objectives Achieved in Phase 1:**

- Reduction of viable hardwood biomass by ~38% in target zone.
- Inhabitant migration from key rural territories up by 64%.
- Local resistance activity minimal, categorized "containable."

**Recommendations for Phase 2:**

1. Deploy sterilized fungal countermeasures in highly visible areas to simulate corporate goodwill.
2. Launch public health initiative blaming "natural fungal bloom" and climate instability.
3. Secure full legislative immunity on [[Hamsterschtein]] via Infrastructure Entitlement Bill (IEB-77).
4. Proceed with extraction of remaining high-density lumber zones.

**Caveats:**

- Unlicensed civilian researcher [[Dr. Asha Lorne]] is missing and may attempt to leak data. If located, neutralize or reacquire.

**RE: Strategic Acquisition Model for Ha’aretsia (Fell’d Tree Initiative)**

Harven,

As discussed on the podcast circuit, [[Ha’aretsia]] provides an ideal _proof of concept_ for symbiotic extraction protocols. It’s unregulated, sparsely represented in galactic policy, and most importantly: emotionally exploitable. The locals _want_ to believe in stewardship — we’ll give them just enough hope before removing it entirely.

By Q3, the timber valuation will spike once public panic hits critical mass. I’ve greenlit the 17X-R variant for controlled deployment. Sal, I know you were concerned about long-term spore evolution — the fertility lock will hold. At worst, the ecosystem collapses and we pivot to off-world remediation services.

If this works — and it will — we scale to other Tier-4 planets by fiscal cycle's end.

Narbu,

You're playing with volatile code. The ethics waiver only covers Ha’aretsia — if this bleeds into Hamsterschtein or elsewhere, we’re exposed. Keep the cross-planet rumors contained. No more podcast teasers.

Gentlemen,

If this earns us exclusive planetary contracts and deters planetary councils from interference, I’m willing to gamble. Let’s run the model — and make sure the PR team is ready with the inoculant story.
