# Summary/Notes
- Done as a Call of Cthulu module. 
- Players met [[Dr. Asha Lorne]] (AKA Dr. Frizzle), a guilt-ridden whistleblower scientist who points the PCs towards Cedrax and gives them more information. 
- [[Cedrax]] Inc. wants to have full access to natural resources on [[Ha’aretsia]] for their packaging business, and engineered the plague (code name: [[Project Fell'd Tree]]) to get the inhabitants to flee. 
- Infecting agent is a unicellular fungi with spore/mating seasons, and one of the only ways to stop it is to introduce variants of the fungi that produce sterile offspring. 
	- [[Cedrax]] deployed the infectious version of the fungi, hoping that they'd formulate the "cure" shortly after releasing the plague. However, they have not yet formulated the cure. 
- The head of Project Fell’d Tree is a Hutt named [[Narbu Sheetu]], and is highly respected by the Cedrax Board for his ability to maximize resource acquisition and profit margins. 
- Narbu caught the attention of the Cedrax Board after several guest appearances on the [[Space Joe Rogan]] podcast, where he first mentioned the need for “developed” worlds to have entitlement to the resources on “underdeveloped” worlds.
