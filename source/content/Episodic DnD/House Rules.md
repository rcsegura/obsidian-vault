## Healing Potions
- Healing Potions can be used as an action to receive the full healing potential of the potion. i.e., using an action to drink a potion of healing (2d4+2) will heal 10 HP. The potion can also be used as a bonus action, but doing so will require rolling for HP gain instead of the full value.

## Critical Hits
- Critical hits are rolling for double damage. I.e. instead of a hit dealing 2d8 damage, on a crit it deals 4d8. 

## Critical Fails on Saving Throws
- Rolling a Nat 1 on a saving throw is a critical failure and results in double damage, if any. This applies to both enemies and players.
