### **Overview**

Dr. Asha Lorne is a microbiologist and former senior researcher in Cedrax Inc.’s Pathogenic Bioengineering Program. Once a loyal employee, she became disillusioned after discovering the corporate directive to artificially accelerate the spread of the [[Ha’aretsia]] plague ([[Project Fell'd Tree]]). Lorne’s disappearance coincided with the internal escalation of the project, leading [[Cedrax]] to label her a “rogue scientist” and a threat to corporate stability.
