Once a normal cat, Dr. Deathwhisker is now an undead professor of comparative necromancy, holding a PhD. He intensely dislikes teaching, but unlives for research opportunities. Like some other academics, he is disdainful of his colleagues and dismissive of those he sees as beneath him. Though professing independence, he secretly dreams of tenure at a posh research institute.

Because he is effectively immortal, he has little fear of field research and will grudgingly take on a graduate student or postdoc as his minion. While he can be a familiar, he will not recognize anyone as a master—at best they might be respected as an inferior colleague in the arts and sciences.

His curiosity tends to lead him into danger, but he is sensible enough to allow others to show him how monsters and traps work.

Despite his arrogance and disdain for teaching, he delights in showing off his knowledge of comparative necromancy. In such matters he has a +10 on his rolls to know things about arcane necromancy and undead creatures. He cannot help but comment, at length, on such matters—which can often prove useful to his minions.

Dr. Deathwhisker can adopt anyone able to cast find familiar becoming their familiar if he so chooses. Interestingly, Dr. Deathwhisker also treats this person as his familiar, as if they were the familiar under the spell rules.
