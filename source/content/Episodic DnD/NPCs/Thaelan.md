Thaelan is an ancient [treant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17037-treant) living and attached to the [[Player's Ship]]. They seem to be extremely ancient, and similar to other treants, see the affairs of mortals around them through the perspective of their gargantuan lifespans. 

Thaelan only communicates with those able to spellcast; anyone else is oblivious to his existence. To those that can hear him, he speaks in huttese.
