Post-Mortem:
- [[Woe]]’s story lines: Finding out more about his sloth god. Protecting Sloths. Potential beef with Space Joe Rogan. 
- Oo’s story lines: Curing planet of disease. 
- [[Cirilla]]’s story lines: collecting more spells. 
- In Norse mythos, [[Nidhogg]] is the god of chaos - might be a good BBEG to bind all these stories together. 
- Nidhogg wants to sow chaos and unravel organized society. It achieves this by whispering ideas into those with weaker wills and bestows them with the capacity to enact Nidhogg’s will. Easy mid-tier boss would be [[Space Joe Rogan]]?
	- Could also be that Sloths inherently represent stillness, which is contrary to enacting chaos - Nidhogg wants to push out that deity’s influence? 
	- If [[Ha’aretsia]] is an agricultural/natural resource boon, it would make sense that Nidhogg would want to destabilize it → infect it with the plague? 
	- Because discourse supports chaos, Nidhogg elevates contrarian/opposition parties wherever it can. 
	- Doesn’t have to be a god I suppose, if we go with the cthulu element it could be an external entity, like an alien invasion force or “will of the universe.”
