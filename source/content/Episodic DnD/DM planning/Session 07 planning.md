# Option 1 - dungeon crawl
The premise of this dungeon is a call for help from a team of archeologists who have uncovered a temple in the tropical south of the region. They have uncovered some sloth-like relics and were in the process of uncovering more until they were forced out by a group of local ruffians. The group is offering 700 GP for rescue and protection while they excavate the ruins. 
- The band of ruffians who have pushed out the archeologists are a gang of monks who heard from [[Space Joe Rogan]]'s podcast that grinding up sloth-relics is a great way to build muscle mass, so they pounced on the opportunity as soon as they heard about the sites discovery. 
- The gang has also "hired" the local goblins to act as their goon guard to beef up their numbers. However, the goblins can be bought out/persuaded to betray the gang for the right offer. 
- The goal for the party will be to rescue any missing archeologists, collect relics for study, and prevent the gang members from destroying artifacts.

# Option 2 - social encounter
The leaders of the planet [[Hamsterstein]] are deliberating on whether or not to financially align themselves with [[Cedrax]]. The job posting is for a team of delegates from [[Ranch]] and [[Haâ€™aretsia]] to sway Hamsterstein away from Cedrax's influence. 

This will involve one combat-like encounter en-route to Hamsterstein, and mostly social encounters once there. 

# Option 3 - CoC module
Some hikers have gone missing in the mountains flanking the [[Hidden Valley]]. There is an offer for 750 gold to find the missing hikers, with an additional bonus of 250 gold if they are brought back alive. CoC module.

# Option 4 - fight, fight, fight! 
A local warlock has hijacked the main road into and out of [[Hidden Valley]], and has imposed a substantial toll for passing through the road. The warlock has manifested a massive familiar to act as a toll collector while the warlock remains guarded in a nearby tower keep overseeing the road. This has led to a massive increase in congestion for travelers, and the town council is offering up 825 GP for resolving this issue.
