**Classification:** Ecumenopolis (urban planet)  
**Population:** ~47 billion (registered), with an estimated 3–5 billion unregistered residents in sublevels.  
**Primary Governance:** Cedrax Corporate Council (Board of Directors functions as de facto government)  
**Known For:** Interstellar trade hub, corporate monopolies, aggressive resource acquisition.

### **Overview**

Cedrax is a sprawling planet-city, an ecumenopolis whose skyline and subterranean sprawl extend across every continent. It is often described as the _“heart of galactic commerce,”_  though critics call it _“the galaxy’s gilded cage.”_

While officially functioning under a public governance charter, the true power lies with megacorporations, most notably **Cedrax Inc.**, whose influence shapes legislation, infrastructure, and planetary exports.

### **Geography & Structure**

The planet’s surface is an unbroken sea of mega-structures, skyways, and docking platforms. Beneath the neon-lit mid-levels lie sublevels that stretch deep into the planet’s crust: vast, neglected industrial zones and undocumented habitation sectors. The atmosphere is heavily filtered through atmospheric processors, masking the smog from centuries of unchecked industry.

### **Economy**

Cedrax thrives on:

- **Interstellar shipping and logistics**
- **Corporate headquarters and R&D facilities**
- **Resource extraction operations** (primarily off-world)
- **High-frequency interplanetary finance**

The planet imports nearly all raw materials and agricultural goods, exporting refined products, advanced biotech, and corporate management services.

### **Culture**

Life on Cedrax is stratified:

- **Upper Levels:** Glittering high-rise districts, corporate enclaves, and entertainment superstructures.
- **Mid-Levels:** Working-class zones, trade markets, and housing towers.
- **Lower Levels:** Abandoned factories, informal settlements, criminal networks, and smuggling ports.

Media is tightly controlled, and corporate PR dominates the planetary infosphere. Dissent is quietly suppressed through legal, economic, or less official means.

### **Reputation**

Cedrax is both admired and feared:

- Admired for its efficiency, wealth, and access to cutting-edge technology.
- Feared for its ability to consume and discard entire worlds in pursuit of profit.
