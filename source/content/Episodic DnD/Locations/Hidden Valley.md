Hidden Valley is a small port-town on the coast of one of the continents on [[Ranch]]. It is predominantly a sea-faring town, but also pulls in resources from nearby woods and trades with distant cities. It is where [[Gob Dom]] docks spare spelljamming vessels that he sells, one of which he sold to the PCs in this adventure. 

There are several shops along merchant's row in town. 

## Shops:
- **Biko's Armory.** 
	- The shop is a single story building of conjured iron, with carved wooden doors and a tiled mosaic floor. The air is filled with thick smoke and the sound of hammers.
	- The shopkeeper is a slender male half-orc named **Biko**. He extends a small discount to clerics.
- **The Fox's Blades.**
	- The shop is a two-story stone-walled building, with several stained glass windows and dwarf-wrought iron furnishings. It appears to be unusually busy.

- **Tate's Marvelous Vault.** 
	- The shop is a two-story stone-walled building, with a gray tile roof. A collection of adventurer's maps hangs from the walls.
