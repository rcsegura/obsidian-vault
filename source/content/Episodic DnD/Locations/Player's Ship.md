The ship was purchased from [[Gob Dom]] at the beginning of the campaign, and is home to [[Thaelan]], the treant living on the ship who speaks in Huttese to those who can cast magic. Thaelan acts as the spelljammer of the ship, and can direct the ship towards it's destination at the request of the crew. 

As part of making the ship a stronghold, PCs can add facilities to the ship to increase their capacity for adventuring. At the start of each session, each player can have their character do one action in one of the facilities. PC's can double-dip, i.e. two characters can start in the garden to get two potions.

# Current Facilities on Ship:

## Garden
A Bastion can have more than one Garden. Each time you add a Garden to your Bastion, choose its type from the options in the Garden Types table.

**Harvest: Garden Growth.** When you issue the Harvest order to this facility, you commission the facility’s hireling to collect items from the Garden as noted in the Garden Types table. The work costs no money.

* We added a house rule that on a nature roll of 20+, you can harvest a greater potion of healing (2d6+4) instead of the standard potion of healing (2d4+2). 

## Sanctuary
Icons of your religion are displayed in this facility, which includes a quiet place for worship.

**Sanctuary Charm.** After spending a Long Rest in your Bastion, you gain a magical Charm (see “Supernatural Gifts” in chapter 3) that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast [Healing Word](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:healing-word) once without expending a spell slot. You can’t gain this Charm again while you still have it.

**Craft: Sacred Focus.** When you issue the Craft order to this facility, you commission the facility’s hireling to craft a Druidic Focus (wooden staff) or a Holy Symbol. The work takes 7 days and costs no money. The item remains in your Bastion until you claim it.

## Smithy
This Smithy contains a forge, an anvil, and other tools needed to craft weapons, armor, and other equipment.

**Craft Options.** When you issue the Craft order to this facility, choose one of the following options:

**Craft: Smith’s Tools.** The facility’s hirelings craft anything that can be made with Smith’s Tools, using the rules in the Player’s Handbook.

**Craft: Magic Item (Armament).** If you are level 9+, can you commission the facility’s hirelings to craft a Common or an Uncommon magic item chosen by you from the Armaments tables in chapter 7. The facility has the tool required to craft the item, and the hirelings have proficiency with that tool as well as proficiency in the Arcana skill. See the “Crafting Magic Items” section in chapter 7 for the time and money that must be spent to craft the item. If the item allows its user to cast any spells from it, you must craft the item yourself (the facility’s hirelings can assist), and you must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.

## Library
This Library contains a collection of books plus one or more desks and reading chairs.

**Research: Topical Lore.** When you issue the Research order to this facility, you commission the facility’s hireling to research a topic. The topic can be a legend, a known event or location, a person of significance, a type of creature, or a famous object. The work takes 7 days. When the research concludes, the hireling obtains up to three accurate pieces of information about the topic that were previously unknown to you and shares this knowledge with you the next time you speak with them. The DM determines what information you learn.
* This has been flavored to be a magic 8-ball that answers in yes/no/maybe fashion.
